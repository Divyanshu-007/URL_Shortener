# URL Shortener Project

This project is a URL shortener implemented in React using the `axios` library for making API requests and the `react-copy-to-clipboard` library for copying the shortened link to the clipboard.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Node.js installed on your system. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the following command to install the project dependencies:
     ` yarn install `
4. After the installation is complete, you can use the `LinkResult` component in your React application.


## Project Description

The URL Shortener project is a React-based application that allows users to shorten long URLs into shorter ones. It utilizes the Shrtcode API to perform the URL shortening. The application consists of a LinkResult component that handles the API requests and displays the shortened link along with a copy button.

When a user enters a URL, the LinkResult component makes an API request to the Shrtcode API and retrieves the shortened link. The shortened link is then displayed to the user, and they can copy it to their clipboard by clicking the copy button.

The project uses React, axios for making API requests, and react-copy-to-clipboard for copying the shortened link to the clipboard. It also includes additional resources such as the React documentation, the Shrtcode API for URL shortening, the Playfair Display font family, and an animated CSS background generator.

## Points to include in resume ( Upper 3 are important )

1. Developed a URL shortener application using React and integrated API communication with the Shortcode API.
2. Implemented state management and side effects using React hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`.
3. Employed version control (Git) to track changes, collaborate with teammates, and manage codebase.
4. Showcased problem-solving skills by handling loading states, error handling, and asynchronous operations.
5. Utilized external resources such as the React documentation, font libraries, and CSS animation generators to enhance the project.
6. Integrated the react-copy-to-clipboard library to enable users to easily copy the shortened URL.
7. Demonstrated proficiency in front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and responsive design principles.
